# Technical Test B

On this occasion, I was given the opportunity to work on Technical Test B, which involved refactoring the code or cleaning it up based on the needs and usefulness of the `main.py` file. This code refactoring was done with the aim of improving separation of concerns, avoiding global state, and making the code easier to test and develop.
